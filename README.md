# MyReads Project

Bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. 

Each book has a control that lets you select the shelf for that book. When you select a different shelf, the book moves there. 

The main page also has a link to /search, a search page that allows you to find books to add to your library.

The search page has a text input that may be used to find books. As the value of the text input changes, the books that match that query are displayed on the page, along with a control that lets you add the book to your library.
